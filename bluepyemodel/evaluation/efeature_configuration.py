        The arguments efeatures and protocols are expected to be in the format used for the
        storage of the fitness calculator configuration. To store the results of an extraction,
        use the method init_from_bluepyefe.

        Args:
            efel_feature_name (str): name of the eFEl feature.
            protocol_name (str): name of the protocol to which the efeature is associated. For
                example "Step_200".
            recording_name (str or dict): name of the recording(s) of the protocol. For
                example: "soma.v" or if and only if the feature depends on several recordings:
                {"": "soma.v", "location_AIS": "axon.v"}.
            mean (float): mean of the efeature.
            original_std (float): unmodified standard deviation of the efeature
            std (float): kept for legacy purposes.
            efeature_name (str):given name for this specific feature. Can be different
                from the efel efeature name.
            efel_settings (dict): eFEl settings.
            threshold_efeature_std (float): lower limit for the std expressed as a percentage of
                the mean of the features value (optional).
            sample_size (float): number of data point that were used to compute the present
                average and standard deviation.
