# MEModel example

## Purpose

This example demonstrates how to retrieve, modify, and update an MEModel by adjusting its morphology and generating analysis plots.

## Usage

   - Update `memodel_id` with the ID of the MEModel you want to modify.

You will be prompted to enter your Nexus access token.

## Notes
